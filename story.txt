Once upon a time there was tardigrade on Mars. His friends called him Terry. Eversince he was born, he wanted to go to another planet, although he never understood the concept of a foreign planet. Everybody thought his dreams were crazy becuse tardigrades didn't have the ability for space travel. 

One day this tardigrade met an entrepreneur named Melon Tusk. Tusk was a very rich man, and was 
looking for tardigrades just like Terry to fly his Resla Toadster convertible into space on a rocket.                                    
Terry merrily took the opportunity, and was soon orbiting Mars.

However he sucks at math and miscalulated some important calculations and thus crashed in mars and met some martians who took him in and taught him their ways of living. hE soon became a martian and lost touch with his human ways
