Once upon a time there was tardigrade on Mars. His friends called him Terry. Eversince he was born, he wanted to go to another planet, although he never understood the concept of a foreign planet. Everybody thought his dreams were crazy becuse tardigrades didn't have the ability for space travel. 

One day this tardigrade met an entrepreneur named Melon Tusk. Tusk was a very rich man, and was 
looking for tardigrades just like Terry to fly his Resla Toadster convertible into space on a rocket.
Terry merrily took the opportunity, and was soon orbiting Mars.
