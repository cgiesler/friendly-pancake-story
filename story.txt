Once upon a time there was tardigrade on Mars. His friends called him Terry. Eversince he was born, he wanted to go to another planet, although he never understood the concept of a foreign planet. Everybody thought his dreams were crazy becuse tardigrades didn't have the ability for space travel. 

One day this tardigrade met an entrepreneur named Melon Tusk. Tusk was a very rich man, and was 
looking for tardigrades just like Terry to fly his Resla Toadster convertible into space on a rocket.                                    
Terry merrily took the opportunity, and was soon orbiting Mars.

However he sucks at math and miscalulated some important calculations and thus crashed in mars and met some martians who took him in and taught him their ways of living. hE soon became a martian and lost touch with his human ways

During his stay at Mars, Tusk kept watching Satellite Television. His favorite show was American Horror Story. In order to better survive on 
Mars, he repeteadly started to watch the Maritan by Matt Demon. 


Every guy that went to that Harvard school seems smart, Tusk thinks. 

He started to plant potatoes and wheat on Mars and eat alien creatures barbeque. His new idol is that Elon Mush dude who kept talking about
the posibility of human having inhabitants on Mars. "What if he succeed one day?" Tusk talks to himself, " I would love to meet someone on 
Tinder here."

Tinder was also popular in many others galaxies. Especially in Milky Way since the signal ain't that good in others planets and some weird-ass planets consider girls
with hairy legs and pupmkin faces pretty.
